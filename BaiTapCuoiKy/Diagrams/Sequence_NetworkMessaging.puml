A -> S : SendDataAsync(NetworkData(Message, "A", "hi"))
S -> B : BroadcastAsync(NetworkData)
B --> B : GameClient_DataReceived -> UI update

A -> S : SendDataAsync(NetworkData(Guess, "A", "CAT"))
S -> A : BroadcastAsync(NetworkData)
S -> B : BroadcastAsync(NetworkData)

note over S
Server is a simple relay in current design.
It does not validate or process commands
(other than broadcasting to clients).
end note
